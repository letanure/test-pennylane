          This is the initial application we've set up for you to start the project.
        </p>

        <p>
          It contains notably:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A page to list all invoices, in <code>app/components/InvoicesList/index.tsx</code></li>
          <li>
            A page to show an invoice <code>app/components/InvoicesShow/index.tsx</code>.
          </li>
          <li><code>react-router</code> to handle navigating between those 2 pages (feel free to add more to suit your needs)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The project is build with TypeScript at the moment, if you're not familiar with typescript and don't want to use it for the test, you can opt-out by running <code>yarn eject_ts</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          You should read the README in this repo carefully if you haven't already, it contains useful information for interacting with the API.
        </p>

        <p>
          We've also implemented two components for you : the <code>ProductAutocomplete</code> and <code>CustomerAutocomplete</code> that you can try out below.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="mb-3">
        <CustomerAutocomplete value={customer} onChange={setCustomer}/>
      </div>
      <div className="mb-5">
        <ProductAutocomplete value={product} onChange={setProduct}/>
      </div>
  </>
}

export default GettingStarted
